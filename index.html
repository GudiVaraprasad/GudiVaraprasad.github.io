				<h3>Robust LLMs for OOD Sentiment Analysis</h3>
				<p>This research, under Prof. Mohit Iyyer, evaluates multiple strategies to enhance Out-of-Distribution
					(OOD) robustness using
					fine-tuned and pre-trained models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and Llama. By implementing zero-shot,
					k-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought prompting, and explanation-based techniques, a 20-30% improvement
					in OOD accuracy over supervised fine-tuning baselines was achieved. Additionally, 4-bit quantization
					for memory optimization was integrated using Unsloth, maintaining performance with explanation-based
					prompting. The findings of the research have been submitted to the 14th Workshop on Computational
					Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment & Social Media Analysis.</p>

					(LLM) accuracy through targeted fine-tuning. Additionally, query generation with lexical
					augmentation was implemented, resulting in a 22.5% accuracy improvement and a 50% increase in
					F1-score. Furthermore, document retrieval was enhanced by implementing top-k extraction using the
					BM25 algorithm, significantly improving performance.</p>

				<h3>Optimizing Meshes to align with Textual Prompts</h3>
				<p>This research, under Prof. Evangelos Kalogerakis, explores the integration of state-of-the-art deep
					learning methodologies to generate and optimize 3D mesh objects. We employed an image-to-3D pipeline
					facilitated by DreamGaussian for initial mesh generation and utilized large language models,
					specifically GPT-4, to derive initial mesh configurations. Subsequently, we enhanced the positions,
					orientations, and scales of these meshes using two optimization techniques: Contrastive
					Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) scores and Score Decomposed Sampling (SDS) loss. The results
					demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy and fidelity of 3D models, marking a notable
					advancement in automated 3D modeling processes.</p>
