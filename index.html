				<h3>Fuzzy Image Clustering via Featured Interval Extraction</h3>
				<p>This research, conducted under the guidance of Assistant Prof. Sheela Jayachandran at the School of
					Computer
					Science and Engineering (SCOPE) at VIT-AP, presents a groundbreaking Python-based machine learning
					algorithm for image analysis. The Fuzzy Image Clustering via Featured Interval Extraction algorithm
					excels with a 100% accuracy rate in overlap distance evaluation, significantly outperforming
					existing methods in datasets with high overlap. Its versatility and precision in multivariate
					statistical applications not only mark a significant advancement in the field but also earned
					recognition through a utility patent (<b style="color: #16b116;">IP India Application No.
						202341029896</b>). This work
					highlights the potential for enhancing image analysis techniques and contributes substantially to
					the research
					community.</p>
